# Flappy Gopher

This is a modified version of Francesc Campoy's flappygopher.

Features:

- Pipes are generated in pairs (top and bottom)
- The distance between pipe pairs is constant
- The gravity is stronger, and the jump a bit stronger
- It uses a neural network to react to the game input
- It uses an incomplete implementation of genetic algorithm to evolve the AI
